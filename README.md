# rock-paper-scissors


this will all function in the console for now

make the computer randomly select one of the three: rock paper or scissors

there are always 3 results, win / lose / draw

the same option = draw
1 of them will = win
1 of them will = lose

will need 3 functions for a user input of rock, paper, and scissors

each of those functions will need 3 else if checks for each potential outcome

you will need to use a prompt function, then return that prompt, if the prompt is invalid, try again,
if they press cancel, show a message, refresh page to play again.
