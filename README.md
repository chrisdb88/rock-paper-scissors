# rock-paper-scissors




this will all function in the console for now

Will prompt for user input.

The computer will generate a number between 1 and 3, which determines which option it chooses. 
Rock, paper, or scissors respectively.

When the user enters an input, it will determine if that input is valid or not, given the options prompted.

If the input is invalid, it restarts the prompt.

If it's valid, it will compare the value of the computer's choice, and the user's choice, to determine who the
victor is for that round. A message will be printed indicating such.

There are 5 rounds.

At the end of the 5 rounds, it tells you if you won, lost, or if it was as draw, and the score is displayed.
